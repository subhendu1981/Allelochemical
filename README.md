# Experimental data
All the experimental data are provided in the 'Experimental_Data_GitHub.xlsx' file.
# Matlab code
The MATLAB code for Fig. 5 in the paper "Allelochemicals Determine Competition and Grazing Control in Alexandrium catenella" is provided. This code facilitates the simulation of the dynamics between two competing species—one harmful and one non-harmful—growing in the presence of a grazer. The model is contained in the file 'alex_tetra_brac_0.m', which should be run and plotted using the file 'plot_alex_tetra_brac.m'. Please ensure both '.m' files are in the same folder to execute the simulation correctly.
